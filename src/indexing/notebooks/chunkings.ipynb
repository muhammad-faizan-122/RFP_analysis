PURPOSE**\\n\\n\\nThis Request for Proposal (RFP) seeks responses from qualified NYSERDA-approved third-party\\nenergy auditors to complete health and safety energy audits on multi-family rental buildings in the Town\\nof Bedford (the “Town”). Successful respondents will be included in a Town-approved list from which\\nlandlords will select and engage directly with the Town of Bedford Building Inspector and other Town\\npersonnel to perform inspections of certain multi-family rental residences located in the Town. These\\naudits are required by the Town’s Landlord Registry and Rental Property Health and Performance Law\\n(the “Law”) and must be conducted on qualified registered rental buildings (defined as 2+ unit rental\\nproperties occupied by unrelated persons) every five (5) years. The Law also requires public posting of\\ninspection results and inclusion of information in building energy reports.\\n\\n\\nSuccessful respondents must participate in the NYSERDA Residential Energy Assessment Program and\\nmust be qualified to inspect buildings for violations of specific New York State Building Code and Fire\\nCode requirements and other health and safety criteria (“Health & Safety Inspections and Audits”). The\\nHealth & Safety Inspections & Audits will operate in conjunction with NYSERDA’S home energy\\nefficiency programs - EmPower+ and Residential Energy Assessment (REA), in order to identify energy\\nperformance improvements and check for New York State Building Code and Fire Code requirements.\\nBoth programs provide no-cost energy audits and income-eligible community members can apply for\\nEmpower+ to receive discounts on energy efficiency upgrades following the audit. It is important for\\ninspectors to share information on tax credits and rebates with building owners so that owners are well\\ninformed about costs and benefits of building upgrades.\\n\\n\\nRespondents who fulfill these requirements and provide a competitive fee to landlords will be given\\npriority consideration.\\n\\n\\n**II. BACKGROUND**\\n\\n\\nThe Town of Bedford is located in Northern Westchester County with a population of approximately\\n17,500 residents and is nearly forty square miles. The Town has approximately 1,300 residential rental\\nunits meeting the criteria for the Health & Safety Inspections and Audits. Widely regarded as a climate\\naction leader in New York State, the establishment of the Law and associated Health & Safety\\nInspections and Audits, and the benchmarking of data obtained during such Health & Safety Inspections\\nand Audits, will allow Town to continue to position itself as a leader with respect to climate action\\nissues. While the genesis of these Health & Safety Inspections and Audits is primarily to ensure health\\nand safety criteria are met, the Town’s goal is to bolster its reputation as a leader in climate issues and as\\nan attractive and sought after community by making benchmarking data from the Health & Safety\\nInspections and Audits publicly available.\\n\\n\\n**III. PROCESS/SCOPE OF WORK & DELIVERABLES**\\n\\n\\n**Inclusion on Town Approved List**\\n\\n\\nSuccessful respondents will be included on an approved Town list of inspectors from which landlords\\nwill engage directly to arrange for Health & Safety Inspections and Audits of qualified rental properties.\\nIn addition to your name and contact information, the Town will include information on its website with\\ninformation about the Law, steps that need to be taken for compliance, and the approximate out of\\npocket costs for the Health & Safety Inspections and Audits.\\n\\n\\nNote: In cases where the building qualifies for an EmPower+ inspection the Town may provide funds to\\nsupplement fees above the NYSERDA incentives using grant funding. Priority for such incentives will\\nbe given to buildings located in the Bedford Hills community zip codes (10507) as they are a\\nNYSERDA previously disadvantaged community (DAC) and currently considered a New York State\\nDepartment of Environmental Conservation Potential Environmental Justice Area (PEJA).\\n\\n\\n**Process for Health & Safety Inspections and Audits**\\n\\n1. **Scheduling.** Building owners will schedule an Health & Safety Inspections and Audits directly\\nwith the inspection company from the approved list consisting of successful respondents to this\\n\\nRFP.\\n\\n2. **Inspections.** Inspector conducts Health & Safety Inspections and Audits (criteria listed in the\\nnext section) and logs results into a form via an online app called Municity. Municity is the\\nTown’s Building Management System. Owners and prospective renters will be able to view data\\nfrom Municity. Results from the Health & Safety Inspections and Audits will have to be\\nsubmitted through both the normal NYSERDA process (EmPower or REA) for reimbursement,\\nas well as into the Town’s online system - Municity. The Municity system can be accessed\\nremotely and online.\\n3. **Benchmarking.** Inspectors that are able to assist in facilitating the collection of energy bills to\\nbe added to Portfolio Manager and set up a building’s Portfolio Manager Account with\\nthe/building owner to allow Benchmarking of particular properties will be favored.\\n\\n\\nBenchmarking is the process of measuring a building’s energy and water use by utilizing the\\nEPA’s Portfolio Manager online software, which allows tracking and comparing energy use over\\n\\ntime.\\n\\n4. **Billing and Payment:** Qualified Inspectors will submit their bill to NYSERDA through the\\nnormal NYSERDA reimbursement process. Any additional cost above the NYSERDA\\nreimbursement will be billed to the owner of the building with details listed below:\\n\\n\\na. For:\\n\\n\\ni. An EmPower audit: the inspector will bill any additional costs, above any\\nNYSERDA reimbursement to the building owner with a copy to the Town. The\\nbuilding owner will be responsible for payment directly to the inspector. The\\nTown may pay the contractor up to 100% of the additional cost on behalf of the\\nbuilding owner if reimbursement funds are available from a grant the Town\\n\\nreceived from NYSERDA.\\n\\nii. Market rate audit: The inspector will submit a bill for the additional cost above\\nany NYSERDA reimbursement, to the building owner with a copy for the Town.\\nThe building owner will be responsible for payment. The Town may pay a\\nportion of the additional cost to the contractor on behalf of the building owner if\\nreimbursement funds are available from a grant the Town received from\\n\\nNYSERDA.\\n\\niii. Grant funds will be distributed for the first round of inspections to pay for Health\\n& Safety Inspections and Audits in whole or in part prioritizing EmPower audits\\nand Market Rate audits on buildings housing low and moderate income residents.\\nOnce grant funds are exhausted they will not be replenished and future Health &\\nSafety Inspections and Audits will be paid fully out of pocket for all building\\n\\nowners.\\n\\n5. **Failed Inspections.** For any buildings that fail a Health & Safety Inspection and Audit, the\\nInspector will be required to report compliance or non-compliance to the Town Building\\nDepartment and the following procedures will apply:\\n\\ni. The Town will require building owners to schedule re-inspections with an\\nInspector within 30 days after receipt of the notice of failure.\\nii. The inspector will be required to provide an affidavit to be submitted to support\\nany re-inspection of the property.\\niii. The cost of the re-inspection should be disclosed to the building owner, and will\\nbe paid by the building owner.\\niv. The Town Building Department may issue a Summons after 60 days of inaction\\nbased on the affidavit provided by inspector.\\nv. If asbestos is found in the dwelling unit the inspector will notify the appropriate\\nNew York State/Westchester County entity.\\nvi. If lead is found in the dwelling unit the inspector will notify the appropriate New\\nYork State/Westchester County entity.\\n\\n\\n**IV.
